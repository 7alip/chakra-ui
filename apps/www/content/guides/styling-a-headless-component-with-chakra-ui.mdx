## Install Ark UI

Start by installing the React version of Ark UI:

```bash
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

## Understand the Component Anatomy

Ark UI breaks each headless component into smaller, functional parts. For
example, some parts of a
(carousel)[https://ark-ui.com/react/docs/components/carousel#anatomy] would be:

`Root`, `Item`, `PrevTrigger`, `NextTrigger` and more.

Each part is flexible and can be styled independently. Once you know what each
one does, it becomes easier to add custom styles to the parts.

## Start with the Basic Demo Example

Head over to the Ark UI component docs, copy the basic usage example, and paste
it into a new component file. This gives you a functional starting point to work
from.

## Import the Chakra Factory

To style Ark UI parts with Chakra, use the (Chakra
factory)[https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/styling/chakra-factory]. The Chakra
factory `chakra()` is a helpful utility that lets you apply Chakra UI styles to
any component.

```tsx title="component-file.tsx"
import { chakra } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Style Component Parts Using the Chakra Factory

Wrap any Ark UI part with chakra() to turn it into a styled Chakra component.

The chakra factory accepts two arguments:

- The component part you wish to style

- An object where you can define base styles

```tsx
const CarouselRoot = chakra(Carousel.Root, {
  base: {
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    alignItems: "center",
  },
})
```

:::info

You can do this for any other parts you wish to style.

:::

## Replace Component Part with Styled Versions

Now that you’ve styled the parts, swap them into your JSX.

```tsx
 //Before
  <Carousel.Root>
     ...
 </Carousel.Root>


 //After
 <CarouselRoot>
     ...
 </CarouselRoot>
```

Repeat this for other parts you styled with `chakra()`.

And that’s it! You’ve now styled a headless Ark UI component using Chakra UI.
