description:
  Used to display quantitative data by filling the area between the line and
  axis, showing trends and patterns over time
---

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-basic" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Chart, useChart } from "@chakra-ui/charts"
import { Area, AreaChart, CartesianGrid, XAxis, YAxis } from "recharts"
```

```tsx
<Chart.Root>
  <AreaChart>
    <CartesianGrid />
    <XAxis />
    <YAxis />
  </AreaChart>
</Chart.Root>
```

## Examples

### Value Axis

Use the `YAxis` component from `recharts` to display the y-axis.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-value-axis" />

### Fill With Value

Use the `Chart.Gradient` component to create a gradient fill that changes from
one color to another based on the value.

```tsx {4-7}
<defs>
  <Chart.Gradient
    id="uv-gradient"
    stops={[
      { offse: "0%", color: "teal.solid", opacity: 1 },
      { offset: "100%", color: "red.solid", opacity: 1 },
    ]}
  />
</defs>
```

When the value is positive, it uses the first color, and when negative, it uses
the second color.

### Percent

To render the area chart as a percentage, with value normalized to 100%:

- Set the `stackId` prop on the `Area` component to the same value
- Set the `stackOffset` prop to `expand` on the `AreaChart` component
- Format the y-axis via the `tickFormatter` prop to percentage format

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-percent" />

### Dashed Area

Set the `strokeDasharray` prop to the `series` you want to display as a dashed
line.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-dashed-area" />

### Gradient Area

Use the `Chart.Gradient` component to create a gradient fill for the area.

> **Note:** The `id` of the gradient must be unique and referenced in the `fill`
> prop of the `Area` component.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-gradient" />

### Dots

Set the `dot` prop on the `Area` component to display dots that map to each data
point.

```tsx
<Area dot={{ fill: "red", fillOpacity: 1 }} activeDot={false} />
```

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-dots" />

### Connect Nulls

Use the `connectNulls` prop to connect data points even when there are `null`
values in between. This is useful when you want to show a continuous line
despite missing data points.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-nulls" />

### Reference Line

Adding a reference line is useful when you want to highlight a specific value in
the chart. Use the `ReferenceLine` component from `recharts` to add this.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-reference-lines" />

### Reference Area

Adding a reference area is useful when you want to highlight a specific range in
the chart. Use the `ReferenceArea` component from `recharts` to add this.

<ExampleTabs name="charts/area-chart-with-reference-area" />

### Area Types

Here are the different types of area charts you can create:

<Box mt="12" borderWidth="1px" ps="3" pe="10" py="10" rounded="l2">
  <ExamplePreview name="charts/area-chart-with-types" />
</Box>
